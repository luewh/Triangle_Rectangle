# Triangle_Rectangle
An PyQT5 UI to calculate angle and length of a rectangle triangle

-run MainTrigo.py to start the program-

-make sure that the image named "TrigoTriangle.png" is at the same root than MainTrigo.py-
-the importation of image was done in trigo.py-

-trigo.ui user interface is created with designer.exe (included in PyQt5)-

-I use  $pyuic5 trigo.ui -o trigo.py  to translate the user interface trigo.ui in python-
-it possible to convert MainTrigo.py to an .exe with  $pyinstaller --onefile -w MainTrigo.py (need to install pyinstaller before)-
